To simply download boole_mc_data.bin, go here -->  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/116253/boole_mc_data.bin

To create a boole_mc_data.bin file with superpixel data just run SetupBoole; gaudirun.py myBoole.py
Some data files from Heinrich are on livlbserv01 /storage/kurt/vp or something


decode.c is to check that the file can be decoded ok.
emu.c is to emulate the velopix but also needs some additional files to do the de-synchronisation 
        it creates a file called spix-latency.txt
        this needs processing to reorder for a particular chip
        e.g. chip 550
                 zcat spix-latency.txt.gz | grep '550$'  | sort -n | ./desync-gwt.py > desync550.txt


NOTE moved the bychip dir to bigdata dir.
run gen_all_chips.sh to regenerate.
